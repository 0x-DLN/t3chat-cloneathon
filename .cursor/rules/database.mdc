## Database

- **Schema Changes**: ALWAYS create migration files when changing the Prisma schema. Use `pnpm db:migrate` to create migrations. Provide descriptive migration names that explain the changes being made.
- **Indexes**: When adding unsupported indexes, create a dummy `@@index` in the prisma schema and alter the migration to be the correct type. Make sure the dummy index uses the correct name
- **Applying Migrations**: After checking and potentially altering migrations, you can apply them using `pnpm db:migrate:deploy`


## Database Schema

The Prisma schema includes a complete authentication system. Do not change any of these:

- **User** - User accounts with email verification
- **Session** - User sessions with expiration and metadata
- **Account** - OAuth and credential accounts
- **Verification** - Email verification and password reset tokens
